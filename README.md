# odin-rockpaperscissors

This is my third project for The Odin Project where I code up a bare-bones web console-mediated game of "Rock Paper Scissors" to put to play what I've learnt in Part 3 of Javascript, particularly functions, if/else conditionals, and working with user inputs.

In this game, the user plays against the computer via the browser's native "prompt" functionality.
